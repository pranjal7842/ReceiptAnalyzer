# Receipt Analyzer

Python based API to extract and identify relevant information in USA sales receipts by using Azure Form Recognizer.


Azure Form Recognizer is a cognitive service that lets you build automated data processing software using machine learning technology. Identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, tables, and structure from your documentsâ€”the service outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file, bounding boxes, confidence and more. You quickly get accurate results that are tailored to your specific content without heavy manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Use Form Recognizer to automate data entry in your applications and enrich your documents search capabilities.

Form Recognizer is composed of custom document processing models, prebuilt models for invoices, receipts and business cards, and the layout model. You can call Form Recognizer models by using a REST API or client library SDKs to reduce complexity and integrate it into your workflow or application.
